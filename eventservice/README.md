# Events Building Block

The goal of the Events Building Block is to provide a set of RESTFul web services to manage events in the Rokwire platform. This includes adding a new event, retrieving relevant events based on search query, etc.
                      

## Setup Environment
```
cd eventservice
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environment File

You need to have a .env file in this directory that contains credentials required for authentication.

Example file format:

```
SHIBBOLETH_HOST=<Shibboleth Host Name>
SHIBBOLETH_CLIENT_ID=<Shibboleth Client ID>

ROKWIRE_API_KEY=<API Key 1>,<API Key 2>,<API Key 3>
ROKWIRE_ISSUER=<Rokwire ID Token Issuer Name>

# AWS environment variables to set when running on development machine. 
# This is not required when running within AWS.
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS Access Key ID>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS Secret Access Key>
```

You also need to set CACHE_DIRECTORY to a valid file folder.
For example:
```
CACHE_DIRECTORY=yourlocalfilefolder
```

## Run in Development Mode

```
cd rokwire-building-blocks-api/eventservice
python api/events_rest_service.py
```
and the Events Building Block should be running at localhost at port 5000 (http://localhost:5000/events).
The detailed API information is in events.yaml in the OpenAPI Spec 3.0 format.

## Run as Docker Container in Local
```
cd rokwire-building-blocks-api
docker build -f eventservice/Dockerfile -t rokwire/events-building-block .
docker run --rm --name events --env-file eventservice/.env -e URL_PREFIX=<URL prefix> -p 5000:5000 rokwire/events-building-block
```
You need to edit config.py where you have to specify mongo url.
```
EVENT_MONGO_URL="mongodb://MongoDBMachinePublicIP:27017"
EVENT_DB_NAME="eventdb"
```

## AWS ECR Instructions

Make sure the repository called rokwire/eventservice exists in ECR. Then create Docker image for Rokwire Platform API and push to AWS ECR for deployment.

```
cd rokwire-building-blocks-api 
docker build -f eventservice/Dockerfile -t rokwire/events-building-block .
docker tag rokwire/events-building-block:latest 779619664536.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rokwire/eventservice:latest
$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-east-2)
docker push 779619664536.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rokwire/eventservice:latest
```

## Sample Events for Post Endpoint:

Let us use ```curl``` command to post two sample events to the Events Building Block running at `http://localhost:5000/events`.


```
curl -d '{
        "tags": ["social", "reading", "coffee"],
        "title": "Reading Day at KCPA",
        "category": "Community",
        "targetAudience": ["students", "alumni", "faculty", "public"],
        "sponsor": "Krannert Center for the Performing Arts",
        "startDate": "2019/05/02T11:00:00",
        "endDate": "2019/05/02T16:00:00",
        "description": "Looking for a casual place to study on Reading Day from 11am-4pm? Krannert Center has got your back: plenty of seating with charging stations, delicious food and beverages available for purchase from Intermezzo cafe, and more.",
        "location": {
            "latitude": 40.1078955,
            "longitude": -88.224036,
            "floor": 2,
            "description": "Krannert Center, 2nd floor"
        }
    }' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5000/events
```

```
curl -d '{
        "tags": ["pi", "pie", "ncsa", "coffee"],
        "title": "Celebrate Mathematic Pi Day",
        "category": "Community",
        "targetAudience": ["staff"],
        "sponsor": "NCSA",
        "startDate": "2019/04/25T13:00:00",
        "endDate": "2019/04/25T16:00:00",
        "description": "celerate mathematic Pi-day at NCSA",
        "location": {
            "latitude": 40.1147743,
            "longitude": -88.2252053,
            "floor": 1,
            "description": "NCSA, 1st floor"
        }
    }' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5000/events
```

It will return back the `post` status in json which includes the internal id as below:

```
{
  	"status": 201,
	"id": "5cd1f7294207d970db70ea92",
	"message": "[POST]: event record created: id = 5cd1f7294207d970db70ea92"
}
```

## One Example of Using Put Endpoint:

Put endpoint allows to replace an existing event with a new one. For example, we can use ```curl``` command to replace one existing event: 
```
curl -d '{
        "tags": ["pi", "pie", "ncsa", "coffee"],
        "title": "We Celebrate Mathematic Pi Day",
        "category": "Community",
        "targetAudience": ["staff", "guest"],
        "sponsor": "NCSA",
        "startDate": "2019/04/25T13:00:00",
        "endDate": "2019/04/25T16:00:00",
        "description": "celerate mathematic Pi-day at NCSA",
        "location": {
            "latitude": 40.1147743,
            "longitude": -88.2252053,
            "floor": 1,
            "description": "NCSA, 1st floor"
        }
    }' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT http://localhost:5000/events/5cd1f7294207d970db70ea92
```
It will return back the `put` status in json, where the `nUpdate` denotes how many event records have been updated:
```
{
	"status": 200,
	"id": "5cd1f7294207d970db70ea92",
	"message": "[PUT]: event id 5cd1f7294207d970db70ea92, nUpdate = 1 "
}
```

## One Example of Using Patch Endpoint:

Patch endpoint allows to update an existing event record. For example, we can use `Curl` command to update the `title` field of the current event: 
```
curl -d '{"title": "NCSA Celebrates Mathematics Pi Day"}' -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/events/5cd1f7294207d970db70ea92
```
You can also update geolocation coordinates. For example, we can update the latitude of location to this new value:
```
curl -d '{"location.latitude": 40.10789}' -X PATCH http://localhost:5000/events/5cd1f7294207d970db70ea92
```
It will return back the `patch` status in json, where the `nUpdate` denotes how many event records have been updated:
```
{
	"status": 200,
	"id": "5cd1f7294207d970db70ea92",
	"message": "[UPDATE]: event id 5cd1ecb94207d96e66ca2e67, nUpdate = 1 "
}
```

## One Example of Using Delete Endpoint:

Delete endpoint allows to delete an event record from the backend storage.
```
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/events/5cd1f7294207d970db70ea92
```
It will return back the `deletion` status in json, where the `nDelete` denotes how many event records have been deleted:
```
{
	"status": 202,
	"id": "5cd1f7294207d970db70ea92",
	"message": "[DELETE]: event id 5cd1ecb94207d96e66ca2e67, nDelete = 1 "
}
```

## One Example of Getting Categories Endpoint:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/events/categories
```

It will return back a list of main categories and sub categories:
```
[
  {
    "category": "Entertainment"
  }, 
  {
    "category": "Academic"
  }, 
  {
    "category": "Community"
  }, 
  {
    "category": "Career Development"
  }, 
  {
    "category": "Recreation"
  }, 
  {
    "category": "Athletics", 
    "subcategories": [
      "Baseball", 
      "Men's Basketball", 
      "Men's Cross Country", 
      "Football", 
      "Men's Golf", 
      "Men's Gymnastics", 
      "Men's Tennis", 
      "Men's Track & Field", 
      "Wrestling", 
      "Women's Basketball", 
      "Women's Cross Country", 
      "Women's Golf", 
      "Women's Gymnastics", 
      "Women's Soccer", 
      "Softball", 
      "Swim & Dive", 
      "Women's Tennis", 
      "Women's Track & Field", 
      "Volleyball"
    ]
  }, 
  {
    "category": "Other"
  }
]
```

## One Example of Getting Super Event Tags Endpoint:
```
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/super-events/tags
```

## Query Search Examples:

### Tilte Search:

This query will return back all events whose title contains the word `pi`.
```
/events?title=pi
```
This query will return back all events whose title contains the word `pi` and `day`.
```
/events?title=pi&title=day
```

### Tags Search:

This query will return all events whose tags contain ``coffee`` `or` ``music``.

```
/events?tags=coffee&tags=music
```

### Target Audience Search:

**Note: This feature in search has been temporarily turned off.**
This query will return all events whose target audience is either ``student`` or ``staff``.

```
/events?targetAudience=students&targetAudience=staff
```

### DateTime Range Search:

This query will return back all events whose startdate and enddate between the range.
```
/events?startDate=2019-04-25T13:00:00&endDate=2019-04-25T17:00:00
```

This query will return back all events whose startDate is between the provided range, including both the dates. This kind of query can be used to find events whose start date falls within a given date range.
```
/events?startDate=2019-04-20T00:00:00&startDateLimit=2019-04-25T23:59:59
```

This query will return back all events whose startdate equal or before the datetime.
```
/events?startDate.lte=2019-04-25T13:00:00
```

This query will return back all events whose startdate equal or after the datetime.
```      
/events?startDate.gte=2019-04-25T13:00:00
```

This query will return back all events whose enddate equal or before the datetime.
```      
/events?endDate.lte=2019-04-25T13:00:00
```

This query will return back all events whose enddate equal or after the datetime.
```    
/events?endDate.gte=2019-04-25T13:00:00
```
### Geolocation Radius Search

This query will return back all events whose geolocation is within ``800`` meter centered at given geolocation point.
```
/events?latitude=40.1078955&longitude=-88.224036&radius=800
```

### Category Search
This query supports main categories search and main/sub categories search. The request can use  `.` to concatenate the search on the combination of the main category and sub category. It can also use `&` to append more category search. In the below search example, the result will contains all the events whose main category is `Athletics` and meanwhile the sub category must be `Football`. The result also contains all the events whose main category is `Community`.
```
/events?category=Athletics.Football&category=Community
```

### Super Event Search
When this query parameter is set to the ID of a super event, the endpoint will return all events as a list (including all the details) that are marked as a sub event of this super event.
```
/events?superEventId=<ID of a super event>
```
If there are other query parameters, then the endpoint will apply those query parameters to filter the subevents search.
```
/events?superEventId=<ID of a super event>&startDate.lte=2020-03-21T07:32:43
```
In this example, the endpoint will return back the subevents with the startdate less than or equal to the given date `2020-03-21T07:32:43`


## MongoDB

You can import predefined categories into the local mongodb.
mongoimport --db eventdb --collection categories --file api/categories.json

Events platform uses MongoDB to facilitate the indexing and searching. Before executing the query search, MongoDB need to enable
text index and geospatial index.

Please refer to: 

https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/text-search/

https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/geospatial-queries/

```
db.events.createIndex({'title': "text"})
db.events.createIndex({'startDate': -1})
db.events.createIndex({'endDate': -1})
db.events.createIndex({'sponsor': 1})
db.events.createIndex({'categorymainsub': 1})
db.events.createIndex({'coordinates': "2dsphere"})
```
