        call that contains a code. That code should then be provided to the
        /authentication/phone-verify endpoint. Note: The phoneNumber property must include a
        prefix plus symbol (+), the country code (e.g., 1 for USA), and the area code.

        Step 2 of 2 for phone number verification. The request body should contain the code
        that was sent to the end user as a result of the /authentication/phone-initiate
        endpoint. phone-verify will check if the code matches what was originally sent to
        the user. Note: The phoneNumber property must include a prefix plus symbol (+),
        the country code (e.g., 1 for USA), and the area code.
